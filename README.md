# Simple-math-test
This is a simple math test. It will ask you basic questions about multiplication, division, addition or subtraction.

PROBLEMS:

The "divide" function sometimes give squestions tjhat have answers that are similar to "1.33333333333335" which is quite annoying.
If anyone has a fix to this I would appreciate it.
